    <h1>Debouncing in Java Script</h1>
    <p>Debouncing is a technique used in JavaScript to limit the frequency of a function's execution. It is particularly useful in scenarios where a function is triggered rapidly, such as during user interactions like scroll events, input events, or resize events. By debouncing a function, we ensure that it is only executed after a certain period of inactivity, reducing unnecessary function calls and improving performance</p>
