    <h1>Promises in Java Script</h1>
    <p>Promises are a JavaScript feature introduced to handle asynchronous operations and make it easier to write asynchronous code in a more readable and manageable way. A promise represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allows you to handle the result of that operation asynchronously. Promises have three different states:
        1	Pending: The initial state of a promise. It means that the asynchronous operation is still in progress and hasn't been fulfilled or rejected yet.
        2	Fulfilled: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation is successfully completed. It means that the promise has resolved with a value.
        3	Rejected: The state of a promise when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or fails. It means that the promise has been rejected with a reason or an error.
